repoConfig
==========

Language: Labview 2013

Pre-requisites:
- mercurial (for mercurial support)

Repository Configurator (repoConfig) is a labview tool for handling multiple repositories.

Main idea:
- Allow the user to use components from many repositories for his projects:
- A configuration file is used to tell which versions of repositories to use
- Commits are tagged with "version x.x.x.x" to show up in the tool

ToDo:
- Nicer UI
- Support for Git
- Support for SVN
- Build script
- Installer Build script
- Command line API
